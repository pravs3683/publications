[Workshop at ABRF 2016 SW4] (https://conf.abrf.org/the-galaxy-platform)

**The Galaxy Platform for Multi-Omic Data Analysis and Informatics**

**Organizers**: Pratik Jagtap and Tim Griffin, University of Minnesota

**Instructors**: Tim Griffin, Dave Clements, Candace Guerrero, Getiria Onsongo and Pratik Jagtap

The workshop material includes a basic introduction to Galaxy framework and its use for ‘omics’ data analysis. 

Workshop goals:

- Introduce the Galaxy framework as a solution for data analysis across ‘omics’ domains
- Provide hands-on experience to attendees in using Galaxy
- Demonstrate use of Galaxy for a proteogenomic analysis (RNA-seq and proteomic integrative analysis)
- Lay the foundation for attendees to implement Galaxy at their own facility or institution to meet ‘omics’ data analysis needs (either specific to one domain or for multi-omics)
